# SVG to iOS Asset Conversion Options

## Option 1: Convert to PDF (Recommended)
1. Open the SVG in a vector editor (Sketch, Figma, Illustrator)
2. Export as PDF
3. Add to Assets.xcassets as a PDF vector asset
4. iOS will automatically scale it for all sizes

## Option 2: Use SF Symbols (if similar exists)
- Check if SF Symbols has a similar icon
- Use `Image(systemName: "symbol.name")`

## Option 3: Convert to PNG assets
1. Export SVG at 1x, 2x, 3x sizes
2. Add to Assets.xcassets as image set
3. Less ideal as it's not vector

## Option 4: Third-party libraries
- SVGKit: `pod 'SVGKit'`
- SwiftSVG: Swift Package Manager support
- Adds dependency but handles SVG directly

## Option 5: Convert SVG path to SwiftUI Path
1. Use online tools like svg2swiftui.com
2. Or manually convert SVG commands to Path
3. Most control but more work
